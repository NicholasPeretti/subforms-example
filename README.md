# Subforms example

This repository has been created as a collection of use-cases where subforms
can help.

The application has the following use-cases:

- sign up
- logged user checkout
- anonymous user checkout

All those forms share some kind of logic and a lot of fields.
Thanks to subforms, you can keep your code DRY and maintain it more easily.

You can read more about the concept of subforms here: [https://dev.to/nicholasperetti/the-concept-of-subforms-with-react-and-formik-55mh](https://dev.to/nicholasperetti/the-concept-of-subforms-with-react-and-formik-55mh)
